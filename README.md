# DSC-WOW_Chat-System

In these troubled times, the need for someone near and dear is more than ever. Connecting friends and family, we are working on a web-based chat system that needs no app download and can run seamlessly even on low bandwidth. The simple user interface can be understood by young fledglings and adults.

The chat system has been made with the help of HTML, CSS, JQUERY, MYSQL, PHP, AJAX and JAVASCRIPT.

To access this file we have to make a database in phpmyadmin
Database name: mydatabase
and then we have to make 3 three tables:
1st table(name: posts) :
  Structure is 
  id     Auto increment on
  msg
  name
  date 
 2st table(name: signup) :
  Structure is 
  uid     Auto increment on
  username
  email
  password 
3st table(name: login) :
  Structure is 
  uid     Auto increment on
  username
  password
